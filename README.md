Data is provided by Stanford University (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) about stop data in Connecticut covering 18 months starting from October 2013. Features are self-explanatory.
I first analyze some aspects about stops in general, drivers, and reasons of stopping. Later, I build a prediction model trying to predict the possible outcome of a driver being pulled over.
